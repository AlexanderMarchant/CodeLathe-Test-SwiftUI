# CodeLathe-Test-SwiftUI

This repository stores the app I have built in line with CodeLathe's test built with SwiftUI.


## The Requirements

#### Public API

I have integrated into the Giphy API (https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/endpoint#search) to enable fetching of gifs that are currently trending, alongside to providing the capability to search for gifs with a particular search term.

If no gifs are found, a message is shown prompting the user to search again.

#### Virtual CV

I have matched the design specified exactly on the Virtual CV screen. (https://www.figma.com/file/HBk47Lh9jTB25NPNOYSdoQ/CodeLathe-Technical-Test)


## The Extras

#### Full Dark Mode support

Use dark mode and the app will change display appropriately.

#### Email in the app

If you click the '@' icon whilst on the Virtual CV screen, you will be able to send an email within the app to the email shown. (Only works on real devices)

#### Call via the app

If you click the 'phone' icon whilst on the Virtual CV screen, you will be prompted to call the number shown. (Only works on real devices)

#### View a Gallery Item

- Press and hold a cell in the Gallery collection view to peak the next screen (using a Context Menu)

- Navigate to a gallery cells information screen to find out more information about it, on this screen you will be able to find:

  - A project description
  - Technology used
  - Challenges faced
  - A project link to see it
